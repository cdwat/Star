STAR Privacy Policy
Last Updated: June 23, 2019

This Privacy Policy explains the information that the STAR app collects when you use its services, how that information is used, with whom it may be shared, and your privacy choices.

1. Introduction.
Who we are and what we do
This Privacy Policy covers the development team behind the STAR app (collectively, "STAR," "we" "us" or "our"). We provide a video-first selling and promotion application for iOS.

Acceptance and Changes
By registering for, downloading, or using our services, you accept this Privacy Policy, which is part of our Terms of Service. We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any modified version of our Privacy Policy at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdwat/Star/master/PRIVACY.md

2. Children's Privacy.
We do not knowingly collect information of persons who are under the minimum required ages specified herein. Persons within the U.S. must be at least 13. Persons who are under 18 must obtain parental consent to use our services.

3. Data We Collect About You.
We collect information about you when you use our services. In addition, third parties may collect information about you when you use our services. Collected information may include or reflect personal information that could identify you, as well as non-personal information. We refer to your information as "your data" for short.

Account Information
To create an account, you must provide a valid phone number. A one-time passcode will be sent to this number to verify your account.

Financial Information
We do not collect or store credit or debit card numbers, nor do we facilitate any financial transactions between users. To buy an item, you will coordinate directly with the seller.

Content
Account holders may create a profile and upload content such as videos, text, photographs, and artwork. Your profile may display information about you and your activities. This information may be accessed by others. Your videos may be viewed and otherwise accessed by others, and associated metadata (e.g., titles, descriptions, tags, etc.) are viewable by others. Your interactions with other users (e.g., comments, "likes," private messages) may be seen by others.

Other Information You May Submit
You may submit data to us for limited purposes such as:
• Requesting customer support; 
• Answering a questionnaire; 
• Participating in a study; or 
• Signing up to receive communications from us or another user.

Automatically-Collected Information
We automatically collect certain types of data when you use our services, regardless of whether you have an account. This data includes your IP address, technical information about your device (e.g., browser type, operating system, basic device information), the web page you visited or search query you entered before reaching us, and your activities. We may track your activities using mobile tracking technologies in order to, for example, authenticate you as a registered user, allow you to use the app’s features, and help us understand how our apps are being used. You cannot opt out of these mobile tracking technologies, but you may uninstall the app.

Information Collected by Third Parties
Some third parties may collect data about you when you use our services. This may include data you submit (such as your phone number) or automatically-collected information (in the case of third-party analytics providers and advertisers).

4. How We Use Your Data.
We may use your data for the following purposes:
• Identification and authentication: We use your data to verify you when you access your account.
• Operating our services: We use your data to provide our services, process and fulfill orders, provide customer support, and to otherwise comply with our contractual obligations to you.
• Communicating with you: We use your data when we communicate with you (e.g., when we respond to a customer support or other inquiry).
• Improving our services: We use your data to understand how our services are being used and how we can improve them. In general, we analyze aggregated data, rather than specific user data. We may, however, need to analyze a specific case to address a specific problem (e.g., a bug that affects only a few accounts).
• Customizing your experience: We use your data to personalize the service to you. This may include remembering your preferences for language or volume or displaying videos that you might enjoy, based upon your viewing choices.
• Exercising our rights: Where reasonably necessary, we use your data to exercise our legal rights and prevent abuse of our service. For example, we may use your data to detect and prevent fraud, spam, or content that violates our Terms of Service.
• Legal compliance: We use your data where we are legally required to do so. For example, we may need to gather your data to respond to a subpoena or court order.
• Protecting your information: Where appropriate, we may anonymize, backup, and delete certain data.

We may use algorithms and other automated means to implement any of the above.

5. With Whom We Share Your Data.
We share data with third parties as follows:
• As you instruct: We may make your profile and videos available to others as you instruct in using our services. We may share your data with persons to whom you have granted account-level access.
• With your consent: We may share your data with third parties where we have obtained your express consent to do so. You may revoke these consents.
• Authorized vendors: We may share your data with third-party vendors that help us operate our services, process orders, and comply with your instructions and our contractual obligations. This includes content delivery networks (CDNs), cloud-based hosting services, monitoring services, email service providers, quality assurance and testing vendors, fraud and abuse prevention vendors, and customer relations management (CRM) vendors.
• Analytics: We may share your data with persons who provide analytics showing how customers are using our services.
• Affiliates and advisors: We may share your data with our parent company eBay, Inc ("eBay"), and our auditors and advisors for planning, financial reporting, accounting, auditing, tax filings, and legal compliance. Unless you expressly agree, we will not share your data with our parent or any affiliate for other purposes, such as direct marketing.
• Certain legal situations: We may share your data where we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or in connection with a corporate transaction as discussed in Section 6.
• Aggregated or anonymized information: We may publicly disclose non-personal aggregated or anonymized information such as our number of visitors and registered users.

We use reasonable efforts to vet vendors for their privacy and data security practices. We require that such vendors agree to protect the data we share.

6. Legal and Safety-Related Disclosures.
We may disclose your data in response to official requests (e.g., court orders, subpoenas, search warrants, national security requests, etc.) ("requests") that we receive from government authorities or parties to legal proceedings.

We handle U.S. requests in accordance with U.S. law. If the request originates from a foreign jurisdiction, we will typically disclose information where we in good faith believe that disclosure is permitted by both U.S. law and local law. In all cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in our sole discretion.

We may disclose user data where we reasonably believe that someone's life is at risk. For example, if we become aware of a person threatening to commit suicide, we may share that person's data with appropriate entities that may have the ability to help.

We may disclose user data to report suspected crimes. We report content suspected of exploiting minors to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) along with the data identifying the uploading user.

We may disclose user data in situations involving legal claims against us or one of our users. If you submit a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or other takedown notice, we may share that notice with the affected user. If you challenge such a notice, we may share your response with the complainant.

We may share your data with potential transaction partners, advisors, and others in the event our company is, in whole or part, acquired by a third party. In such case, we will use reasonable efforts to require the acquiring entity to comply with this Privacy Policy.

7. Data Retention.
We retain your data for as long as you have an account. When you close an account, we will delete its content, including its videos. 

We may retain:
• Logs of automatically collected information (for internal analytics); 
• Your phone number; and 
• Communications with you.
When we no longer have a business reason for retaining data, we will delete or anonymize it.

We retain deleted videos on our servers for a short period in case you wish to reverse deletion. Once we delete a video, we may not be able to recover it.

If we receive legal process pertaining to your account, we will retain your data for as long as we in good faith believe is necessary to comply with the legal process. Similarly, if we believe that your account has been involved in wrongdoing, we may preserve your data to defend or assert our rights.

8. Your Privacy Choices.
We enable you to make numerous choices about your data:
• You may choose not to provide us with certain information. For example, you may choose not to create an account or not to provide optional account information.
• You may change or correct information voluntarily submitted to us. We encourage you to keep your data current by viewing your profile page.
• You may close your account (which will delete all videos) or delete certain videos.
Users from certain countries may have additional rights. See Section 14 for more details.

9. Account and Video Privacy Settings.
Our video hosting and sharing tools do not offer the ability to limit the distribution of your content, including your videos. All videos on our platform are publicly-available. You may delete videos to make them inaccessible to others.

10. Communications from Us.
Mobile Device Communications
We may, with your consent, send push notifications in our apps. You may disable these by declining them or changing the app's settings. To the extent provided, we may, with your consent, send SMS messages to your mobile telephone for authentication and security purposes. You may opt out of receiving such messages at any time.

11. Protecting Your Information.
We use physical, technical, and organizational security measures to safeguard your data from unauthorized or accidental disclosure. Despite these efforts, no information system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Users also have a role to play in keeping their data safe. You should only grant access rights to people who you know and trust, and, even then, you should be careful in granting all access rights. You should monitor your account regularly. If you believe that someone has gained access to your account without your permission, please contact us immediately so that we can investigate.

12. Your Responsibilities
You may receive other people's data in using our service. If you receive information from other users, you must comply with all laws, including those concerning privacy, data security, and online marketing.

13. Third-Party Services
We may provide links to online services that we do not own or operate. These services fall outside of this Privacy Policy and we have no control over the data they collect. For example, if you click on a link to connect your STAR account to an eBay account, you may be taken to eBay's website. Once on a third-party site, your data may be collected by others. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such services before using them.

14. International Data Transfers and Certain User Rights.
14.1 Location of Data.
STAR is based in the United States. We provide services within the U.S. using computer systems, servers, and databases located in the U.S. and other countries. When you use our services from outside of the U.S., your information will be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the U.S. and other countries.

14.2 California User Rights.
California residents have the right to opt out of disclosing information to third parties for the purpose of allowing such third parties to directly market their products and services. At this time, we do not engage in this type of disclosure. If you have questions, please contact us.
