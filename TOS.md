STAR Terms of Service Agreement
Last Updated: June 23, 2019

This STAR Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement" or "Terms of Service") is made between the development team behind STAR ("STAR," "we," "us," or "our") and you, our customer ("you" or "your"). STAR provides a video-first selling and promotion service (collectively, the "Services"). This Agreement governs your use of our Services.

1․ Acceptance
================

By creating an account, viewing videos, downloading our app, or otherwise visiting or using our Services, you accept this Agreement and consent to contract with us electronically.

If you are an entity other than a natural person, the person who registers the account or otherwise uses our Services must have the authority to bind the entity. In this context, "you" means both the entity and each person who is authorized to access the account.

We may update this Agreement by posting a revised version on the iOS App Store. By continuing to use our Services, you accept any revised Agreement.

This Agreement includes our Privacy Policy and the addenda listed in Section 10 below. Please review our Privacy Policy to learn about the information we collect from you, how we use it, and with whom we share it.

2․ Our Services
================

Service License: Subject to the terms hereof, we grant you access to our Services. This includes the right to:
* Stream videos that you have the right to view;
* Upload and store videos; and
* Use all related functionality that we may provide.
The features available to you may change from time to time.

Downloadable Software: We may offer applications for devices ("Apps") directly or through third-party stores. Apps are governed by our End-User License Agreement ("EULA").

3․ Accounts
================

Registration: You may create an account to use certain features we offer (e.g., uploading videos). To do so, you must provide a phone number. You consent to receive text notices from STAR at this phone number.

Organizational Accounts: Corporate, governmental, and other organizational users must publicly display the legal name of their entity on their public account profile.

Age Requirements: You must be at least 13 years old to create an account. If you wish to use the Services for a commercial purpose, you must be at least 18 years old. If you are at least the requisite age, but are still a minor in your jurisdiction, you must have your parent or legal guardian's permission. Please have that person read this Agreement with you and consent to it before proceeding.

Parents and Guardians: By granting your child permission, you agree to the terms of this Agreement on behalf of your child. You are responsible for monitoring and supervising your child's usage. If your child is either under the applicable age or does not have your permission, please contact us immediately so that we can disable access.

Account Security: You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including unauthorized activity. You must safeguard the confidentiality of your account credentials. If you are using a mobile device that others have access to, you must log out of your account after each session. If you become aware of unauthorized access to your account, you must notify us immediately.

4․ Acceptable Use Policy

You must ensure that your content, and your conduct, complies with the Acceptable Use Policy set forth in this Section 4.

5․ Licenses Granted by You
================

As between you and STAR, you own and will retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in and to the content you submit. In order to allow STAR to host and stream your content, you grant STAR the permissions set forth below.

5․1 Your Video Content
----------------
By submitting a video, you grant STAR permission to:
* Stream the video to end users;
* Distribute the video via our APIs;
* Transcode the video (create compressed versions of your video file that are optimized for streaming); and
* Generate stills (i.e., "thumbnails") from your video to represent it.
By enabling access to your video to any third party, you grant each such person permission to stream (and/or download or embed, as applicable) your video. For the purposes of this Section 5.1, your video includes its title, description, tags, and other metadata.

The license period begins when you submit the video to STAR and ends when you or STAR delete it; provided that STAR may retain archival copies: 
(a) for a limited period of time in case you wish to restore it; 
(b) when the video is the subject of a takedown notice or other legal claim; or 
(c) when STAR in good faith believes that it is legally obligated to do so.

5․2 Account Profile
----------------
You grant STAR permission to use your name, likeness, biography, trademarks, logos, or other identifiers used by you in your account profile for the purpose of displaying such properties to the public or the audiences you have specified. You may revoke the foregoing permission by deleting your account.

5․3 Other Content; Feedback
----------------
Content that is not covered by the licenses set forth in Sections 5.1 or 5.2 shall be governed by this Section 5.3 (e.g., text you submit in comments). You grant STAR a perpetual and irrevocable right and license to copy, transmit, distribute, publicly perform, and display such content through online means in connection with our Services. If you make suggestions to STAR on improving or products or services, STAR may use your suggestions without any compensation to you.

5․4 Scope of Licenses
----------------
All licenses granted by you in this Section 5: 
(a) are non-exclusive, worldwide, and royalty-free; 
(b) include the right and license to copy, use, distribute, publicly perform, and display the licensed work for the purposes stated above; and 
(c) include all necessary rights and licenses to allow us to exercise our rights and perform our obligations. By granting these licenses, you waive any so-called "moral rights" that you may have. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a license "condition" applicable to STAR; rather, any breach of a term by STAR hereof shall give rise to, at most, a claim for breach of contract only.

6․ Your Obligations

----------------
For each piece of content that you submit to or through STAR, you represent and warrant that:
* You have the right to submit the content to STAR and grant the licenses herein;

* The content does not, and will not, infringe any third party's rights, including intellectual property rights and privacy rights; and
* The content complies with this Agreement and all applicable laws.

6․2 Indemnification
----------------
You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless STAR and its subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents, from and against all third-party actions arising from: 
(a) the content you submit to or through the Services; and 
(b) allegations of actions or omissions by you that (regardless if proven) would constitute a breach of this Agreement.

7․ Term and Termination
================

This Agreement begins when you first use our Services and continues so long as you use our Service or have an account with us, whichever is longer. STAR may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing thirty (30) days’ written notice, and users may terminate at any time by deleting their accounts.

If you breach this Agreement, STAR may, at its option: 
(a) terminate this Agreement immediately, with or without advance written notice; 
(b) suspend, delete, or limit access to your account or any content within it.
If STAR deletes your account for breach, you may not re-register.

In the event of any termination or expiration, the following sections will survive: Section 6.2 (Indemnification), Section 8 (Disclaimers), Section 9 (Limitation of Liability), and Section 10 (General Provisions).

8․ Disclaimers

STAR PROVIDES THE SERVICES ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. YOU USE THE SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK. You must provide your own device and Internet access.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, STAR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Among other things, STAR makes no representations or warranties:
* That our Services, or any part thereof, will be available or permitted in your jurisdiction, uninterrupted or error-free, or accessible from all devices or browsers;

10․ General Provisions
================

Choice of Law: This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the state of California and the United States of America (with respect to matters subject to federal jurisdiction such as copyright), without regard to principles of conflicts of law.

Choice of Venue; Jury Trial Waiver: Any action relating to this Agreement or your use of our Services must be commenced in the state or federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California, United States of America; you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts. IN ANY SUCH ACTION, STAR AND YOU IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.

Reservation of Rights, Severability, Force Majeure: STAR reserves all rights not expressly granted herein. STAR’s rights and remedies are cumulative. No failure or delay by STAR in exercising any right will waive any further exercise of that right. If any term of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be limited or severed. STAR will not be liable for any delay or failure caused by a force majeure event.

Relationship: You and STAR are independent contractors of one another; neither party is an agent, partner, or joint venturer of the other. This Agreement binds the parties and their successors, personal representatives, and assigns. You may not assign this Agreement to any person whose account has been terminated by STAR or who is prohibited from registering; any such assignment will be void.

Third Parties: We may provide links to and integrations with websites operated by others. The website operator, not STAR, is solely responsible for the content thereof, and your use of each such website will be subject to its terms of service. We may disable integrations with any third party at any time, with or without notice. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this Agreement confers any right on any third party.

Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties and supersedes all prior understandings regarding the subject matter hereof and may not be modified except in accordance with Section 1 or in a document executed by authorized representatives of STAR. If you have a signed agreement with STAR, any conflicting term of that agreement will prevail over the terms hereof, but only as to the subject matter of that agreement.
